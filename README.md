# Library

## Summary

This is a mock Library where you can add books via the button to add the title, author, how many pages it has and if it has been read or not via a form. After the form is submitted the information is passed through an Object Constructor and pushed through a function to add the visual div as well as pass the book object into an array. The array index is tied to a generated data-attribute.

## Key Features

- **Add Books**: Users can add books to library and define their name, author, page count and read status.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can delete individual books or toggle read status on hover.
